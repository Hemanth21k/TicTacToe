# TicTacToe
A simple AI TicTacToe built with pygame.
The AI is a game playing agent which makes its best possible decisions based on the search algorithm.
Multiple search algorithms like MinMax, Alpha Beta puring , Depth limited Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search were implemented.

### Playing TicTacToe
To play the game simply run the <code>TicTacToe.py</code> file and then: 
1) After pygame window pops up select the game you want to play.
2) Select 1 for tic tac toe and 2 for open field TicTacToe.
3) If you select 1 then select the algorithm and play.
4) press r to reset at anytime and esc to exit.
5) If you select 2 then enter the Grid size and give the number of
   connecting pieces.
   
#### Game Algorithms
1) MinMax
2) AlphaBetaPruning
3) Depth Limited Search
4) Combination of AlphaBetaPruning and Depth Limited Search
5) Monte Carlo Tree Search
